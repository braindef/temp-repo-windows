Thank you for producing and promoting virtual modular software.

+ it is great because buying software produces much less CO2 than buying a real physical Modular
+ one can save configurations persistent

- on the other hand, having real modular and possibly tweak around the cirquit improves the electronics skills
 a) one idea mitigate this situation would be with a module, that allows to plug and patch "virtual electronic components"
  1. CPU Power will still increase in the future
  2. i don't know how to do that since the components would be reduced to more or less a formula, but i'm not a professional in Sound Algorithms, so i just place this idea here
 b) another idea would be to give kids other electronics to play with, i had my first electronics kit by the age of 6 years
