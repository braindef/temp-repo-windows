but is battling with bipolar. [2]
He is officially diagnosed with ADD (unofficially diagnosed as bipolar). [3]
At this point, he is willing to allow me to figure out help. [4]
He sees a psychiatrist who prescribes him  Xanax and Adderall [5]
but not currently treating him for Bipolar Disorder. [6]
He is a filmaker, there is alcohol involved at times, [7]
he has an irregular, nocturnal schedule which doesn't help.  [8]
Where do I begin?  What kind of Dr., treatment,  prescription is needed/recommended? [9]
When he gets triggered, [10]
he goes off on his girlfriend and begins destroying their house. [11]

=====================================
Does he have Computer Science skills?

[1] mistake 1: being brilliant implies that group of less briliant people would like to hunt him down, i know that since i said 13 Years before snowden that there is someting wrong with the networks

[2] curve discussion sin(t)

[3] ADD differntial diagnosis would be autism, would be an addtional hint that he is autistic, some shrinks tend to diagnose ADD to discredit the gifted children since autistics anyway would try to find the complete truth

[4] great that he as such a nice sister, but be careful if he is that brillian they would try to play out you two or three against each other

[5] drugs are poison for autistics

[6] he is maybe not bipolar, but being diagnosed bipolar would be better than schizophrenic becaues TV tells us that this people are all murderers. tell him that, and that is maybe autism.

[7] self medication

[8] this would mean that he tries to find "paces" where the voices don't hunt him, my schedule is also noctural since the people that try to hunt me down are from my town

[9] autism test, but not where he is threaten noramlly, or an internet test

[10] when he is being triggered, that there are implants against Epilepsy is reverse psychology, if he is brillian we should talk

[11] someone tries to separate them, separating autistics for partner would lead often to suicde
