Hello @DanieleGanser and @debian #Linux
(DANGER: if true your Systems will maybe swap to @DEFCON 2)

you explain the "brutkastenlüge" ("Nayirah testimony"). In my opinion this situation it is way more complex:

they use the a14 Card

In the news you hear such things about people or groups where they really kill kids or babies for trauma based mindcontrol purposes, but only the cases that "prove" that the targeted group is a liar.

- Ian Ashley Murdock
- the guy that wanted to provide code to the kernel and linus torvalds
(Maybe induced with something like r905 and 2cm wire in amygdala)
- maybe more, thin in question, "family tree walker algorithme" since to many dead debian members would rise questions

this could then be "used" by satan with the voice code

"activate prepared new fake facebook profile, that revictimizes one of such a m46 Card in context to the thing that is most important for the target (that seems to be normally me)" -- TraumaBased MindControl

Count of such cases would be intentionally only a bit more than normal distributed, so maybe only autistic people would notice that and would get paranoid because of that.

People like @snowden, @ioerror @julian

they would >> maybe << not kill because since many people would notice that, but Ian Ashley Murdock or tron (@ccc) was only know in the #Linux / #Hacking community.


meme, traumabased mindcontrol, would hate the kill command, revictimizing the dead of ian murdoch, revictimizes linus torvalds becuase they made him guilty wiht the alleged induced suicide of a person that wanted to contrubute to kernel
