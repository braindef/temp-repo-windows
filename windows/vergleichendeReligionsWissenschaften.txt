With about 20 i found out, that i was left behind, begun to do criticism because of the cellar room

my parents knew, that this was a bad idea to put me in the cellar, but they thought that i would not suffer from that

so my parents brought me to a psychiatrist

I was diagnosed Schizophrenic too.

I told my equal aged friends that "i have schizophrenia" i maybe should have said "i was diagnosed schizophrenic"
(it was a lie, i suffer from autism a differential diagnosis of schizophrenia)

The Shrink knew that, he sold my parents sweet lies, because when a kid is diagnosed schizophrenic then his/her wrongdoing is because of the kid

If the Shrink would have diagnosed autism they could not have blamed me for the cellar room

People are empatic beings that need other beings

i stalked your Facebook profile and like my you seem to cope with that sutiation with, Arts, Culture, Music, Religion, Comparative Religion Sciences... The Book "Die Schachnovelle" [1] from "Stefan Zweig" [2] explains why people do develop coping strategies in such situations. He was arrested because he did not told the nazis where Church Treasures were, so they locked him in a small room with no books, no contacts because they knew, that is an intellectual person would suffer in such a situation. but he did not told the nazis until the end of the war.

Funny thing, i somehow had to develop a coping strategie to, so i became something like a hacker, wanna play a game agaist my computer chess program [3] that is completely written by me?
