

Cause:
Parental narcisstic Power abuse

-> beeing chief implies that they are the top most node and there for dont have to suffer anymore from unfair actions because they have now the role of the parents
-> they would do the same (bad) things to people lower in the hierarchy as their parents (Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, Benjamin Bloom)
-> kind people would criticize his/her behavior he took from his parents
 -> at least the subconsciousness of the the person with the hubris syndrome would agree with the criticism
  -> would induce a cognitive dissonance
   -> would induce rage
    -> ...

Workaround:
reparenting the people with hubris syndrome with an +/- equal aged peaceful, educated or religious person
and show the hubris syndrome person that there could be another live


furter:
in 2020 maybe parents have even access on the infrastructure or even "Raum√ºberwachung" of the hubris syndrome person, would know how to abuse their stimulus-response-habits, are therefor maybe something between a NPC or a robot maybe even witout Isaac Asimov's tree laws
